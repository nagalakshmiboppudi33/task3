Project Title:
  Algo-Trading Market Analytics & Prediction System 
Object:
  The aim of the project is to analyzes historical market data , extracts insights using statistical techniques,and also prrdicts the future price movements using machine learning models
The projects targets on :
 --> Data collection and preparation
 --> Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
 --> Predictive modelling
 --> Trading strategy simulation
Tools :
 Python & libraries :
     .pandas 
     .numpy
     .Seaborn 
     .Matplotlin
     .sklearn
 Environment: 
         VSCode
 Version Control : 
         Git & GitHub
--> Data Collection & Preparation :
     In this I used the NSE (National Stock Exchange ) & BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) historicala data.Which dataset includes the open price, close price,low price, close price ,volume these are the types of data columns i used.
     Steps :
     . Data cleaning and formating.
     . Handling the missing values: these are handleded using the mean replacement and forward filling.
     . merging the datasets wirh NSE_BSE dataset with extra_dataset if needed.
     . After these steps dataset is cleaned and useful for further steps.
  --> Feature Engineering :
       Featured Engineering is useful  for creating new features from raw data for improving model prediction accuracy easily.
       steps :
       . EMA: helps to identify the trend direction.
       . RSI: helps to measures market momemtum ,tells the stock is oversold or over brought.
       . MACD: measures the strength and direction of trend based on the ema.
       . Volatility & ATR(Average True Range)
--> Exploratory Data Analysis :
     EDA is for performing and understanding market behaviors and patterns.
     Thsi includes the price trens ,volume analysis,volatility analysis,candle stick-based behavior .
--> Predictive Analysis : 
     Prediction Analysis redicts the next-day price movement.Creates two models 
     .Random Forest clasiifier and
     .XGBoost classifier      
    Theses two models can accuratly compare scores  and performance scored based on the results.
    Random is for small datasets and have high accuracy compared to XGBoost ,and XGBoost is for very large datasets.
--> Trading Strategy Stimulation :
     Trading strategy decides to measure probability of the model which decides 
     buy when RSI < 30
     sell when RSI > 70
     hold when RSI between 30-70
     And it generate ssmall no of trades because small dataset.
     performs total profit/loss,win ratio,accuracy ,draw down calculation.

Steps To Run The Project 
  --> Step-1 : Install python latest version , and install this libraries pandas,numpy,scikit-learn,seaborn,xgboost,matplotlib using pip install command.
  --> step-1 : For  dataset of NSE/BSE data run the command
       command :NSE_BSE_analysis.py
       output in : NSE_BSE_analysis.csv
  --> Step-3 : To run data cleaning script 
       command : py .\data_cleaning_featured.py
       output in : cleaned_data.csv
  --> Step-4 : To run featured engineering script
       command : py .\featured_engineering.py
       output in : featured.csv
  --> Step-5 : To run EDA script
       command : py .\EDA.py
  --> Step-6 : To run models Script 
       command : py .\models.py
  --> Step-7 : To run trading script 
       command : py .\Trading_strategy.py
