--> Market Behavior patterns Identified :
      Market behavior depends on the historical data analysis , and it shows the market market upward and downward movements on a limited dataset.The price changes are gradually and sudden changes in volatility are rare . Moving averages and MACD values indicate momentum-based behavior and also prices follows the recent trends in a short period.
--> Best Performing Model :
      Among the test models i used :
       . The Random Forest performed better than the  XGBoost on the shortest dataset.
       . The Random Forest can achieves the higher accuracy than the XGBoost because , it can handles the small datasets and more efficient.
       . And also XGBoost gives the unstable results only due to the small datasets and it needs more data for learning complex data patterns.
       . So , the Random Forest is the best performing model.
--> Strengths And Limitations :
      Strengths :
        . I can use indicators like EMA,MACD,Volatility which improves the decision making.
        . Strategy logic is simple and easy to predict .
        . backtesting provides the understanding of trading strategy.
      Limitations : 
      . Dataset is small,so it limits the predict accuracy.
      . RSI indicator is not be fully used due to missing values.
      . This analysis are for the acedemic demonstration only,not for real trading.
--> Trading strategy Performance :
      . Generates a small no of trades because limited data.
      . It shows the profit and loss results.
      . And it shows the accuracy,win ratio,and draw down calculations.
--> Recommendation Trades:
      It recommendes that learning algorithm ,understanding techincal indicators,backtesting techinques.
      For the real world apply the strategy on large datasets,for better results.
